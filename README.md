# the-miller-pioneers: Monitoring Building Sides for SBB

This is the winning project of the 2020 edition of Polyhack. 

The solution is a webapp that allows planning engineers at SBB to identify severe problems in the current building side planning structure. The tool is constructed with the python frameworks dash and utilizes the `data.sbb.ch` endpoints.


## Usage
The programm can simply be started by installing the requirements, activating the virtual environemt and running:

```shell
python3 app.py
```

This will start an application that will run on localhost and can be accessed through any webbrowser. 

## Functionality
An overview of the functionality can be seen in the `polyhack_presentation.pdf`
